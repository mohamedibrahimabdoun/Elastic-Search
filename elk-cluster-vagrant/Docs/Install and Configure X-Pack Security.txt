Instructions & Tasks
You work as a system administrator and are in charge of a 3-node Elasticsearch cluster that has been used for ad-hoc, non-sensitive data analysis. However, your Business Intelligence office would like to start using this cluster to analyze some sensitive customer data, so they need you to secure the Elasticsearch cluster to meet the following data security requirements:

Cluster network encryption
Client network encryption
User authentication
To do this, you will need to install X-Pack, which has been pre-downloaded to /home/elastic/x-pack.zip. After installation, you will need to create a certificate authority (CA) using X-Pack's certutil tool, and then use the CA to create node certificates for each Elasticsearch node. The CA and node certificates should be password-protected and stored in the /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/certs directory.

To support full verification mode, the node certificates should be generated as follows:

Name	DNS	IP	Filename	Password
node1	ip-10-0-1-101.ec2.internal	10.0.1.101	node1.p12	elastic_node1
node2	ip-10-0-1-102.ec2.internal	10.0.1.102	node2.p12	elastic_node2
node3	ip-10-0-1-103.ec2.internal	10.0.1.103	node3.p12	elastic_node3
Donâ€™t forget to add the password you used to protect the certificate package to the local Elasticsearch keystore on each node as both the truststore and keystore secure password.

###############################################################

1) Install X-Pack on each Elasticsearch node.
---------------------------------------------
sudo su - elastic
Install X-Pack
Change directory to the Elasticsearch installation path.
cd /home/elastic/elasticsearch
Install X-Pack with:
./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///home/elastic/x-pack.zip
Grant additional permissions for X-Pack at the prompts by typing Y and pressing Enter.
Repeat
Repeat these steps for node2 and node3.


2- Use the X-Pack `certutil` tool to generate a certificate authority.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Log In
Using the Secure Shell (SSH), log in to node1 as cloud_user via the public IP address.
Become the elastic user with:
sudo su - elastic
Generate the Certificate Authority (CA)
Create a certs directory.
mkdir /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/certs
Change directory to the certs directory.
cd /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/certs
Create a CA certificate with:
/home/elastic/elasticsearch/bin/x-pack/certutil ca
Use the default output file.
Set the CA password to elastic_ca.
Disseminate the CA to the Cluster
Remote copy the CA to node2.
scp /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/certs/elastic-stack-ca.p12 cloud_user@10.0.1.102:/tmp
Remote copy the CA to node3.
scp /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/certs/elastic-stack-ca.p12 cloud_user@10.0.1.103:/tmp
Install the CA on Nodes 2 and 3
Using the Secure Shell (SSH), log in to node2 as cloud_user via the public IP address.
Become the root user with:
sudo su -
Change the ownership of the CA.
chown elastic:elastic /tmp/elastic-stack-ca.p12
Become the elastic user with:
su - elastic
Create a certs directory.
mkdir /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/certs
Move the CA into the certs directory.
mv /tmp/elastic-stack-ca.p12 /home/elastic/elasticsearch/config/certs/.
Repeat these steps for node3.
